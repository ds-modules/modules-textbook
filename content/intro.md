## Data Science for the Social Sciences

It is no secret in industry that data has impacted every facet of human life. In the modern age, researchers are now adopting new techniques to leverage data science and statistics to their unique disciplines. At the Data Science Education Program (DSEP) at UC Berkeley, we believe in providing opportunities to students to be exposed to this paradigm shift.

Feel free to take a look at the wealth of curriculum resources on the left of the screen.

## Jupyter Books

This website was created using [Jupyter Books](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html). Jupyter Books lets you build an online book using a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown files. Its output is similar to the excellent [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) tool, and adds extra functionality for people running a Jupyter stack.

For an example of a book built with Jupyter Books, see the [textbook for Data 100](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/) at UC Berkeley.

Here are a few features of Jupyter Books

* All course content is written in markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, stored in `notebooks/`
* The Jupyter Book repo comes packaged with helper scripts to convert these into Jekyll pages (in `scripts/`) that can be hosted for free on GitHub
* Pages can have [Binder](https://mybinder.org) or JupyterHub links automatically added for interactivity.
* The website itself is based on Jekyll, and is highly extensible and can be freely-hosted on GitHub.
* There are lots of nifty HTML features under-the-hood, such as Turbolinks fast-navigation and
  click-to-copy in code cells.
