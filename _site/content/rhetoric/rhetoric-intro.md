# Rhetoric Introduction Modules

Welcome to the Rhetoric modules! The Rhetoric Department has a few courses for which modules were created, some of which are listed below.

### XRHETOR R1A: Moral Foundations Theory

These modules connect word use in political speeches to the Moral Foundations Theory. Statistical inferences and visualizations from this data help students look for rhetoric differences between conservative and liberal presidential candidates. Students then engage with and critique data-driven methods themselves as rhetorical tools. This module is meant to take 3 class periods for students with minimal to no coding experience.
