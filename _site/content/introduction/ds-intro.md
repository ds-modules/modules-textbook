# Data Science Introduction Modules

Welcome to the introduction for data science! If this is your first exposure ever to the data science realm, this is the place for you. Take a look at the sidebar to view the topics of this first chapter. Not only will you be exposed to the fundamentals of inferential thinking, but you will also get an in-depth introduction to the Python programming language as well, which is a widely-used tool in data analysis.

If you are comfortable with all the material that is presented, then go ahead and move on towards exploring the vast wealth of modules that the Data Science Education Program offers at UC Berkeley.
