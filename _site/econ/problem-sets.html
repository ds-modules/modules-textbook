<h4 id="estimating-national-product">Estimating National Product</h4>

<p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis measures national product in two different ways: as total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services and as the total income of everyone in the economy. Since – as you learned in earlier courses – these two things are the same, the two approaches should give the same answer. But in practice they do not.</p>

<p>For the period 2006:Q4–2012:Q4, get quarterly data on real GDP measured on the expenditure side (referred to in the National Income and Product Accounts as “Real Gross Domestic Product, chained dollars” – these are the headline GDP numbers you will see discussed in the news) and real GDP measured on the income side (referred to as “Real
Gross Domestic Income, chained dollars”).</p>

<p>Consider an economy in which the depreciation rate is 2% per year, the rate of population increase is 1% per year, the rate of technological progress is 1% per year, and the private savings rate is 17% of GDP. Suppose that the government increases its budget deficit–which had been at 1% of GDP for a long time–to 5% of GDP and keeps it there indefinitely.</p>

  <li>Suppose that environmental regulations lead to a diversion of investment spending from investments that boost the capital stock to investments that replace polluting with less-polluting capital. In our standard growth model, what would be the consequences of such a diversion for the economy’s capital-output ratio and for its balanced-growth path? Would it make sense to say that these environmental regulations diminished the economy’s wealth?</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="savings-rates">Savings Rates</h4>

<p>Consider an economy in which the depreciation rate is 4% per year, the rate of population increase is 1% per year, the rate of technological progress is 2% per year, and the national savings rate is 21% of GDP.

<p>Many project that by the middle of the twenty-first century the population of the United States will be stable. Using the Solow growth model, what would the qualitative effects of such a downward shift in the growth rate of the labor force be on the growth of output per worker and to the growth of total output? (Consider both the effect of zero population growth on the steady-state growth path, and the transition from the “old” positive population growth to the “new” zero population growth steady-state growth path.)</p>

<h4 id="long-run-models">Long Run Models</h4>

<p>Consider an economy with the production function: $Y=K^\alpha(EL)^{1−\alpha}$ on its steady-state balanced-growth path:</p>

<ol>

<h4 id="escape-from-the-malthusian-trap">Escape from the Malthusian Trap</h4>

<p>Suppose somebody who hasn’t taken any economics courses were to ask you why humanity escaped from the Malthusian trap–of very low standards of living and slow population growth rates that nevertheless put pressure on available natural resources and kept output per worker from rising–in which humanity found itself between the year 8000 B.C.E. and 1800. What answer would you give? (One paragraph only, please!)</p>

<h4 id="malthusian-economy">Malthusian Economy</h4>

<p>Suppose—in the Malthusian model with natural resources—that population growth depends on the level of output per worker, so that:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">n = 2.00002 \left ( \frac{Y}{L} - \\$400 \right )</script>

<p>That is, the population and labor force growth rate $n$ is zero if output per worker equals \$400, and that each \$100 increase in output per worker raises the population growth rate by 0.2 percent per year. Suppose also that the natural-resources parameter β in the production function: $Y = K^\alpha (EL)^{1 - \alpha - \beta} (ER)^\beta$ is 0.2. Suppose also that $gL=0$.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If $gR=0.2\%$ per year, what is the steady-state rate of population growth? If it is 0.4% per year? 1% per year?</li>
  <li>How long does it take the population to double for each of the efficiency-of-using- resources growth rates above?</li>
  <li>By what multiple does the population grow in a millennium for each of the efficiency-of-labor growth rates in (a) above?</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="malthus">Malthus</h4>

<h4 id="argentina">Argentina</h4>

<p>In 1960, Argentina had a level of output per worker of $14,000/year. In the 1940s and 1950s it had had a savings-investment share of 24% and a labor-force growth rate of 2% per year. Since 1960 Argentina has averaged a savings-investment share of 15% and a labor force growth rate of 1%/year. Assume that Argentina in the 1940s and 1950s had an efficiency of labor growth rate g of 1%/year. Assume α= 2⁄3. Assume the depreciation rate δ is 5%/year. Assume that Argentina in 1960 was on its 1940s and 1950s steady-state balanced-growth path, and that Argentina today is on its post-1960 balanced growth path.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What was Argentinaʼs capital-output ratio in 1960?</li>
  <li>What was Argentinaʼs efficiency of labor E in 1960?</li>
  <li>If the efficiency-of-labor growth rate had been 1%/year since 1960, what would Argentinaʼs efficiency of labor, capital-output ratio, and level of output per worker be today?</li>
  <li>If the efficiency of labor growth rate had been 2%/year since 1960, what would Argentinaʼs efficiency of labor, capital-output ratio, and level of output per worker be today?</li>
  <li>If the efficiency of labor growth rate had been 3%/year since 1960, what would Argentinaʼs efficiency of labor, capital-output ratio, and level of output per worker be today?</li>
  <li>If the efficiency of labor growth rate had been 4%/year since 1960, what would Argentinaʼs efficiency of labor, capital-output ratio, and level of output per worker be today?</li>
  <li>If the efficiency of labor growth rate had been 5%/year since 1960, what would Argentinaʼs efficiency of labor, capital-output ratio, and level of output per worker be today?</li>
  <li>Argentinaʼs level of output per worker today is $27000/year. What do you guess its growth rate of the efficiency of labor has been on average since 1960?</li>

<h4 id="constant-returns">Constant Returns</h4>

<p>Suppose we have our standard growth model with s =15 percent, n = 1 percent, g = 1 percent, and δ = 3 percent. Suppose also that the current level of the efficiency of labor E is \$5,000 per year and the current level of capital per worker is \$25,000. Suppose further that the parameter α in the production function is equal to 1: α = 1.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What can you say about output per worker in this economy? What would you project output per worker to be at some point in the distant future?</li>
  <li>Suppose the savings rate s is not 15 percent but 17.5 percent. How would that change your projections of the future growth of output per worker?</li>
  <li>What effect does growth in the efficiency of labor have on output per worker when α = 1?</li>
  <li>Why aren’t the normal Solow model tools of analysis and rules of thumb much use when α = 1?</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="computer-revolution">Computer Revolution</h4>

<p>Today it appears that because of the computer revolution the rate of growth of the efficiency of labor in the United States has more than doubled, from 1.0 percent per year before 1995 to about 3.0 percent per year since. Suppose this increase were to be permanent.Suppose the rate of labor force growth were to remain constant at 1 percent per year, the depreciation rate were to remain constant at 3 percent per year, and the American savings rate (plus foreign capital invested in America) were to remain constant at 20 percent per year. Assume that the efficiency of labor in the U.S. in 2006 is $18,500 per year, and that the diminishing-returns-to-capital parameter α is 1/2.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the change in the steady-state capital-output ratio because of this acceleration in efficiency-of-labor growth? What is the new steady-state capital- output ratio?</li>
  <li>How would such a permanent acceleration in the rate of growth of the efficiency of labor change your forecast of the level of output per worker in 2040?</li>
  <li>How would your answers to (a) and (b) be different if α were 1/3? If it were 2/3?</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="capital">Capital:</h4>

<p>Suppose that you misestimate the capital stock—think that its rate of growth is lower than it actually is—but otherwise understand the parameters and the growth rates of the base-camp Solow growth model. How will your conclusions about the sources of economic growth be off?</p>

<h4 id="prices-of-capital-goods">Prices of Capital Goods</h4>

<p>Let us suppose that the price of capital goods in terms of output-in-general P(k) varies, so that the law of motion for the capital stock in the Solow growth model is not:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dK}{dt} = sY − δK</script>

<p>but is instead:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">dKt = \frac{sY}{P(k)} − δK</script>

<ol>
  <li>Derive the steady-state balanced-growth capital-output ratio (K/Y)* for this model in which the price of capital goods varies.</li>
  <li>Suppose that richer countries have lower prices of capital goods according to: Y−η PK =L Using your answer from (5), suppose that η=1/3. Now consider the three cases of α equal to 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75. Suppose that something happens in the economy to permanently increase the savings rate from 20% to 21%.</li>
  <li>By what proportional fraction does steady-state output-per-worker increase relative to its previous steady-state balanced-growth path?</li>
</ol>

<p>Take a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita_per_hour — the wikipedia page for “List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita per hour.” Select some countries that were once ruled by Communist governments and compare them to neighboring countries that were lucky enough to escape Communist rule.

  <li>Researchers who are trying to estimate the effects of changes in government purchases on real GDP often focus on military purchases because: a. The types of government purchases that policymakers are likely to use to combat a recession are similar in important ways to military purchases. b. Wars are often accompanied by price controls, which makes them particularly good times for isolating the effects of changes in government purchases. c. Changes in military purchases are caused mainly by geopolitical developments outside the United Sates, not by other factors affecting U.S. GDP. d. It is hard to obtain data on non-military purchases.</li>
  <li>“asset price bubble” means: a. A large, rapid rise in asset prices. b. A rise in asset prices that is reversed.c. A rise in asset prices in response to reductions in interest rates. d. Asset prices being greater than their “fundamental” values.</li>
  <li>Suppose a variable, y, is determined by a factor we can measure, x, and by other factors that we cannot. That is, y = a + bx + e, where a and b are parameters and e is the unobserved other factors. Estimates of b from a regression of y on x (estimated by “ordinary least squares”) will tend to overestimate the impact of x on y if: a. x and e are negatively correlated (that is, e tends to be low when x is high, and high when x is low). b. x and e are uncorrelated (that is, x has no consistent relationship with e). c. x and e are positively correlated (that is, e tends to be high when x is high, and low when x is low). d. a and x are positively correlated.</li>
  <li>The fact that the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers nearly caused the failure of institutions that had made loans to Lehman Brothers is an example of: a. “Confidence” contagion. b. “Coordination” or “Fire sale” contagion. c. “Counterparty” contagion. d. None of the above.</li>
  <li>The “borrowing” interest rate, rb, is usually higher than the “saving” interest rate, rs, because: a. Financial intermediaries’ information production, liquidity transformation, and diversification provision are costly. b. Government regulations limit the interest rates that banks can pay. c. The interest rates that foreigners can get on their savings are generally lower than interest rates in the United States. d. The inflation rate faced by savers is usually lower than the inflation rate faced by borrowers.</li>

<h4 id="financial-crisis">Financial Crisis</h4>

<p>This problem asks you to perform an event study. In the extension of the IS-MP-IA model to include an interest rate differential, a financial crisis is assumed to raise the differential. This problem therefore asks you to investigate whether interest rate differentials (often referred to as interest rate spreads) rose at the time of some of the major events associated with the financial crisis in the fall of 2008.</p>

<p>Specifically, consider the difference between the interest rates on BAA corporate bonds and on 30-year Treasury bonds. And consider any 3 of the following 4 events, all of which occurred in September 2008: (1) The government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; (2) Lehman Brothers’ announcement that it would file for bankruptcy; (3) The government takeover of AIG; (4) The House of Representatives’ rejection of the initial TARP legislation. (Note: no extra credit for considering all 4 events.)
a.</p>
<ol>
  <li>For each event that you chose, find the day that it occurred. As far as you can tell, did it occur when financial markets were open (which, loosely speaking, corresponds to normal working hours in New York) or when they were closed? Describe how you found this information and how confident you are about it.</li>
  <li>For each event, if it occurred when financial markets were open, find the change in the interest rate spread on the day of the event. If financial markets were closed, find the change in the spread on the next day of trading. Did these events lead to noticeable increases in the interest rate spread? Be sure to describe where you found your data.</li>
  <li>What was the overall change in the spread from the end of August 2008 to the end of October 2008?</li>
  <li>For many economic relationships (for example, between money and output), we would not expect a big effect in a day. Explain why one might or might not expect the worsening of a financial crisis to have a noticeable impact on interest rate spreads in a day.</li>

<h4 id="risky-interest-rates">Risky Interest Rates</h4>

<p>Our model with an interest rate differential assumes that all investment depends on a single interest rate, rb. In truth, there are many interest rates, and they are relevant to many different kinds of investment.</p>

<p>To partially capture this idea, suppose investment is the sum of two types of investment, a safer type I1 and a riskier type I2. I1 depends on rb1 and I2 depends on rb2: I1 = I1(rb1), I2 = I2(rb2), where both functions are decreasing. Suppose also that rb1 – rs = d1(Y) and rb2 – rs = d2(Y), again with both functions decreasing. To reflect the idea that Type 2 investment is riskier than Type 1 investment, assume that for a given Y, rb2 – rs is greater than rb1 – rs, and that when Y falls, rb2 – rs rises by more than rb1 – rs does.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In this model, suppose there is a fall in consumer confidence, so that C for a given Y – T is lower than before.
i. What is the effect of this change on rs, Y, rb1 – rs, and rb2 – rs? ii. Is the change in rb1 – rs larger, smaller, or the same as the change in rb2 – rs, or is it not possible to tell?</li>
  <li>One message we have stressed is that a modeling assumption is not inherently “good” or “bad”; the value of an assumption depends on the question we are trying to answer. Thus, give one example of a question that moving from a model with just one interest rate differential (rb – rs) to one with two differentials (rb1 – rs and rb2 – rs) would be helpful in answering. Give one example of a question where moving from a model with one differential to a model with two would complicate the analysis without generating any significant additional insights.</li>

Back in 1992 Brad DeLong and Larry Summers argued that this made it desirable for the Federal Reserve to have an inflation target of 4-5% per year rather than 1-2% per year: the higher inflation target, you see, would give the Federal Reserve more ability to reduce the long-term real interest rate when necessary.

<h4 id="flexible-price-world-foreign-exchange-crises">Flexible Price World Foreign Exchange Crises</h4>

<p>Start out with our consensus flexible-price model in “difference” form, the relevant parts of which are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ΔY = ΔC + ΔI + ΔG + ΔX − ΔIM  <br />
ΔC = Cy x (1−t)(ΔY)<br />
ΔI = ΔI0 − Ir(Δr) <br />
ΔX = Xε(Δε) <br />
Δε = Δε0 − εr(Δr)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and let’s consider the effect of a collapse of confidence in the currency—a large sudden € rise in the Δε0 parameter that governs long-term expectations of the price of foreign currency.</p>

<p>Suppose that there are no effects on the supply side—ΔY=0—no effects on investor confidence—ΔI0=0—no effects on imports—ΔIM=0—and that government spending is unchanged as well—ΔG=0.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the flexible price model, solve for the equilibrium changes in the exchange rate ε, in the interest rate r, in investment I, and in exports X as a result of the rise in
Δε0.</li>
  <li>Suppose that the cause of the crisis is that government spending is rising rapidly and that investors have no confidence that the budget will ever be balanced, and thus that the government bonds they own will ever be repaid without inflation. Thus there is a relationship between government spending and the change in expectations of the exchange rate: Δε0 = θΔG for some value of the parameter θ. Now solve for the equilibrium changes in the exchange rate ε, in the interest rate r, in investment I, and in exports X as a result of the rise government spending G.
€
ΔY =ΔC+ΔI+ΔG+ΔX −ΔIM ΔC = Cy (1− t)ΔY
ΔI=ΔI0 −IrΔr−Iε(Δε)2 ΔX = XεΔε
ΔIM = −IMyΔY Δε=Δε0 −εrΔr</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="sticky-price--price-world-foreign-exchange-crises">Sticky Price  Price World Foreign Exchange Crises</h4>

<p>Now let’s turn to the consensus sticky-price model, the relevant parts of which are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ΔY = ΔC + ΔI + ΔG + ΔX − ΔIM  <br />
ΔC = Cy x (1−t)(ΔY)<br />
ΔI = ΔI0 − Ir(Δr) - Iε(Δε)^2 <br />
ΔX = Xε(Δε) <br />
ΔIM = −IMy(ΔY) <br />
Δε = Δε0 − εr(Δr)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and once again consider the effect of a collapse of confidence in the currency—a large sudden rise in the Δε0 parameter that governs long-term expectations of the price of foreign currency—this time in the short run in which full employment is not guaranteed, and in which the real interest rate r is chosen by the central bank. And not the extra term in the investment equation: a large shift in the exchange rate causes massive bankruptcies, destabilizes the financial system, and causes investment I to collapse and output Y to fall.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Solve for the change in the exchange rate as a function of the change in the interest rate r, and then turn that around: if the change in the exchange rate is going to take on a certain value Δε, what must the change in the interest rate Δr be?</li>
  <li>Now let’s view the central bank as choosing not the interest rate but the exchange rate. In this model, solve for the change in output ΔY as a function of the change in the exchange rate Δε (taking account of the fact that the central bank must choose the change in the interest rate Δr to make the change in the exchange rate equal to the chosen value.</li>
  <li>What is the best that the central bank can do in the short run. Where should it choose to set the exchange rate and the interest rate (bearing in mind that they are linked) to make the effects of the crisis as small as possible?</li>
  <li>Suppose that the IMF is on hand to help, and to give the central bank extra foreign exchange R that it can then spend to affect the exchange rate: Δε = Δε0 −εr(Δr) −εr(ΔR). Solve for how the best the central bank can do is affected by the addition of more help from the IMF.</li>
