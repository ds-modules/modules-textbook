# Cuneiform Introduction Modules

Welcome to the Rhetoric modules! The Rhetoric Department has a few courses for which modules were created, some of which are listed below.

### CUNEIF 102A: Sumerian Text Analysis

**Course Description:** In each semester of this course, the student who has completed the first year of the study of Akkadian will read a variety of texts in the cuneiform script either of the Old Babylonian or the Neo-Assyrian periods. In any semester, the texts to be read may be drawn from a variety of text genres: legal, mythological, historical, prayer, etc., but each semester will focus on only one genre.

**Module Description:** This module works with an interesting data set, the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (ETCSL). These texts are translated from fragmented tablets as old as 6000 years. The techniques used in this module are less common in text analysis such as k-means, hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling. These provide the ability to classify a newly translated text with past Sumerian literature as well as create interesting tree graphs and clusters. The module is designed for students with little-to-no coding or statistics experience.
