# Psychology Introduction Modules

Welcome to the Psychology modules! The Psychology Department has a few courses for which modules were created, some of which are listed below.

### PSYCH 167AC: Implicit Bias and Social Outcomes

This module introduces students to correlation and regression analysis. Students pick from a set of datasets on health outcomes, and a set of datasets on implicit bias, both at the county level for the entire US. They then merge the two datasets by census code and measure correlation and regression to see if there are interactions between biases and health outcomes. The module is designed for students with little-to-no coding or statistics experience.
