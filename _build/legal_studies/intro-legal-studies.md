# Introduction to the Legal Studies Modules

## LEGALST 190: Data, Prediction, and Law
Data, Prediction, and Law is a new Legal Studies seminar that allows students to explore different data sources that scholars and government officials use to make generalizations and predictions in the realm of law. The course also introduces critiques of predictive techniques in law. Students apply the statistical and Python programming skills from Foundations of Data Science (Data 8) to examine a traditional social science dataset, “big data” related to law, and legal text data.
