The course will concentrate on basic mechanisms underlying human life processes, including cells and membranes; nerve and muscle function; cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and gastrointestinal physiology; metabolism, endocrinology, and reproduction.</p>
<p><strong>Module Description:</strong> This module consists of six labs, where students analyze data they have collected. The first lab introduces Jupyter Notebooks, teaches basic coding in Python, and graphing with matplotlib. Second lab focuses on graphing the data collected at the lab. Third lab focuses on creating tables and analyzing the data collected using an electromyogram (EMG). The fourth and fifth labs focus visualizing the data and finding trends. In the last lab, the students are exploring the data on diabetes in an attempt to find out which health measurements are correlated the most with diabetic patients.</p>
